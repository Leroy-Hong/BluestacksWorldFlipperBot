# BluestacksWorldFlipperBot
A non-user friendly python programme for bluestacks automation 
of a game known as world flipper. (for personal use)

Code is horribly unoptimized, still working on it.
I am a beginner programmer and made this as a hobby

Use of pyautogui to read data on the bluestacks emulator,
therefore emulator has to be in foreground
and cannot be blocked by other windows.

Use of win32 libraries to interact with emulator directly,
thus this programme will not take control of your cursor
(for the mini) and or keyboard.

Do note that bluestacks custom controls
have to be setup before using this programme.

Basically dm me if you need help running it. (Sorry strangers)
